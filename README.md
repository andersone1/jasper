# jasper

Static HTML pages describing the drug development pipeline.

## GitHub Pages

The site is published with GitHub Pages. Pushing changes to `main`
triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys the contents of
the repository to GitHub Pages.

After the workflow runs, the site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/jasper/` (replace `<username>` with the GitHub account that owns this repository).
